## Windowshade Chrome Extension

# About

This is the Windowshade Chrome Extension, available [on the Chrome App Store](//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/windowshade/hjjgbonlbpglkgemffbbjllpiifdcfga). Replaces the new tab page with a clock that shows the current color of the sky. Inspired by a night I accidentally pulled an all-nighter and didn't realize the sun was already up.

# Everything else

This project has no external dependencies or build instructions, just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Have fun!

# Thanks

The code used to calculate sunrise/sunset times is heavily based on code from the NOAA. It is contained in the file `noaa.js`.
This project also uses [Moment.js](//www.momentjs.com), [jQuery](//www.jquery.com).
